# [Project 1 : Basic Data Analysis and Visualization of Life Expectancies and Suicide Rates across 132 countries](https://jovian.ai/maherdaoud/myfirstproject)

In this beginner friendly project, I've analyzed life expectancies and suicide rates across 132 countries in the world. 
  * **Python libraries used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


# [Project 2 : Solving a Machine Learning problem using Sci-kit for Linear Regressions](https://jovian.ai/maherdaoud/project2)

This project takes a coding-focused approach to solve a real Machine Learning problem. I started by analyzing Data visually using different libraries to plot graphs and then moved on to solve the problem manually and then with scikit-learn to encourage a deeper understanding of the problem.
  * **Python libraries and modules used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-Learn
